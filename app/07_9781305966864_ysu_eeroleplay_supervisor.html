One of the most concerning failures of workers is not keeping a supervisor current on potential crises. The supervisor, in turn, must listen actively to the practitioner’s concerns and provide mentoring and guidance where needed, while delegating responsibilities appropriately.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, the case manager of a women’s protective services agency evaluates a domestic violence situation in coordination with her supervisor to make a time-sensitive decision.</p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>A woman calls the police reporting that she has been battered by her husband. This is one of several calls over the past year. On this occasion, however, she is concerned about the health and safety of her five children and asks for help in leaving. Police officers are dispatched and the first responder on the case contacts the local women’s protective services to determine whether emergency shelter can be arranged. Tara Lopez, the case manager for the evening must quickly evaluate the case and report back to her supervisor, Jose, who tends to be more hands-off and also unavailable in the evenings. What steps can she follow in the crisis intervention model?  	</p><h1>Note for the Supervisor, Jose </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Jose Rodriguez, the supervisor at a women’s protective agency. You have protocols in place for domestic violence incidents, which you think provide sufficient guidelines for your case managers to make decisions. However, the case manager at WPS feels that your direct assistance will be needed to move the woman and her children to shelter, and calls you for advice. How do you respond? </p><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Examine and implement crisis intervention.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Use supervision and consultation to guide professional judgment and behavior.</p><p>A-head: Crisis Intervention</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
