Disagreements over goals, methods, ideas, or almost any other topic can lead to conflict. Conflict is also a natural outcome of our efforts at advocating for others. And in the best case scenario, conflict can be positive and lead to new ideas and change.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, an administrator and a practitioner at a social services agency attempt to discuss differences in opinion about a policy at their agency in an effective manner.    </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>A conflict is brewing within the staff of the Loving Arms Hospital social work department regarding how to handle a hospital-proposed reduction in patient services. The supervisor, Charlene Diller, is concerned about the apparent split developing over this proposal and arranges a meeting to hear the issues numerous practitioners have raised. One social worker, Ron Barry, has been particularly vocal via e-mail and not surprisingly, is the first to speak up at the meeting.   </p><p>&lt;practitioner/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Practitioner, Ron </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Ron Barry, a social worker under the supervision of Charlene Diller. You are the most senior social worker in the unit, and voice your anger over the proposed changes at the hospital. You state:</p><p>“We have always been a department that offered help to anyone we felt was at high risk. That risk could be financial, emotional, social, or medical.  We’ve never set some group aside and said, ‘We won’t help you.’  That’s not what social work is all about.” “This hospital has built a fine reputation and we’re not going to let it get destroyed without a fight.”</p><p>As you listen to Charlene’s reaction and prepare a response, think about how to use your mezzo and macro practice skills. </p><ol><li>What types of mezzo and macro skills does Charlene use? </li><li>What skills or strategies can you use in your response to Charlene? </li><li>With what skills and strategies do you feel most comfortable?  Why?</li></ol><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Utilize effective macro-practice skills, including evaluating results, fund-raising, budgeting, negotiating, mediating, influencing decision makers, needs assessment, planning, and working with coalitions.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Facilitate effective transitions and endings that advance mutually agreed-on goals.</p><p>A-head:  Using Empathy, Interpersonal Skills, and Group Skills in Macro Practice</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
