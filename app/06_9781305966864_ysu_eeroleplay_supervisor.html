These workers must be able to move the wheels of change from a job not necessarily intended for that purpose.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, an administrator and practitioner at a social services agency assess their respective styles of leadership and collaborate to find the best approach to implementing change within their organization. </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>Jenna Walker is a supervisor in a rural county social services agency and Sara Gonzalez is a social worker who reports to her. The towns within the county range in size from 1500 to 10,000 people, and the area has become increasingly impoverished as a number of small factories have closed. Sara comes up with an idea to start a community food drive and proposes it enthusiastically at a staff meeting. Jenna responds cautiously, and suggests that they arrange a meeting to discuss the initiative. Eager to move forward, Sara sends Jenna a follow-up e-mail with additional materials before the meeting. Jenna reads through these in preparation and considers how to respond.      </p><p>&lt;supervisor/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Supervisor, Jenna </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Jenna Walker, the supervisor at the social services agency. In terms of leadership styles, Jenna display characteristics of what is known as a “conserver”. She prefers to preserve the homeostatic status quo, and is very thorough and procedural in her work. Some people at the office have even referred to her as a “typical bureaucrat.” Jenna loves filling out forms on a routine and timely basis. She tends to be a strong proponent of goal displacement: quality of service is not of much concern to her unless it involves your higher priority of following the rules. She is generally skeptical of fresh and innovative ideas that might disrupt the steady flow of paperwork. In addition, she knows that her team is overworked. </p><p>As you listen to Sara, try to think about and appreciate the positive qualities of her leadership style – the fact that she is so enthusiastic, energetic, and innovative. Imagine and then acknowledge how the project will help the community, the agency’s clients, and the agency itself.</p><p>At the same time, you have an obligation to expect a certain amount of detail in Sara’s proposal to effectively evaluate it. You should carefully assess what problems are most critical to address and you have only so much time, energy, and general resources. </p><p>Think about which problems might best translate into needs as you meet with Sara on a macro, mezzo, and micro level. Be open to discussing differences of opinion and ways in which how you can collaborate together to come up with the best solution. </p><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Demonstrate professional demeanor in behavior; appearance; and oral, written, and electronic communication.</p><p>A-head: Planning in Generalist Practice: Integrating Micro, Mezzo, and Macro</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
