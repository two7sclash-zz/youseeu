These workers must be able to move the wheels of change from a job not necessarily intended for that purpose.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, an administrator and practitioner at a social services agency assess their respective styles of leadership and collaborate to find the best approach to implementing change within their organization. </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>Jenna Walker is a supervisor in a rural county social services agency and Sara Gonzalez is a social worker who reports to her. The towns within the county range in size from 1500 to 10,000 people, and the area has become increasingly impoverished as a number of small factories have closed. Sara comes up with an idea to start a community food drive and proposes it enthusiastically at a staff meeting. Jenna responds cautiously, and suggests that they arrange a meeting to discuss the initiative. Eager to move forward, Sara sends Jenna a follow-up e-mail with additional materials before the meeting. Jenna reads through these in preparation and considers how to respond.      </p><p>&lt;practitioner/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Practitioner, Sara </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Sara Gonzalez, a social work practitioner at the social services agency. Sara’s leadership style is that of a zealot. She is a go-getter who exudes energy and thinks of creative, innovative ways to bring about change. However, as a budding social worker, she is very preoccupied with herself, and tends to think that she knows best, regardless of others’ opinions. She may assume that Jenna will be on board with her macro change proposal, and may not see Jenna’s point of view, depending on how it fits into your view of the universe.</p><p>As you listen to Jenna’s appraisal of your proposal, try to see her responsibilities as an administrator and the need to weigh several factors that might affect her organization on a macro level. Propose why your initiative is necessary by outlining how you evaluated the potential for macro-level intervention. Address the following questions:</p><p>1. How heavily is the problem affecting clients’ well-being?</p><p>2. Is the problem serious enough to merit macro change?</p><p>3. Are you willing to think through and appraise your actual potential to make a difference?</p><p>4. Are you certain that your clients would support such a macro change and that it is in their best interest?</p><p>End with briefly defining and prioritizing any problems you anticipate with your initiative. Note that innovations can involve tried-and-true methods that are well known elsewhere but are totally new in your own agency. </p><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Demonstrate professional demeanor in behavior; appearance; and oral, written, and electronic communication.</p><p>A-head: Planning in Generalist Practice: Integrating Micro, Mezzo, and Macro</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
