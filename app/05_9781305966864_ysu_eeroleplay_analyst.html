The problem-definition stage of assessment should enable you to determine, with some degree of assurance, who is affected by the problem, to what extent, and what sort of remedy might be appropriate. No matter how the problem comes to your attention, research must be done very carefully to ensure that you have all the needed data. </p><p>Objective</p><p>In this role play, a social science analyst designs a model to research an urgent community issue surrounding school violence for a town meeting. The analyst must find relevant and accurate data to support a shift in local school policy, as the school chancellor is hesitant to make any sweeping changes.</p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>The tiny community of Kingdom Come, an idyllic-looking rural area in Michigan, is in an uproar after 16-year-old Estrallia Compton was killed by a fellow student, Helena Troy. Estrallia was a member of a gang of “mean girls” at school. They were a very powerful group and one student said they were, “like, rockin’ with the Facebook combat!” Apparently Helena had been an online “target” of Estrallia, to the point that Helena felt the only way out was to “plug the b - - - -.”</p><p>A town seminar has been called to focus on these gangs and gang violence. The local social services agency has been called in to research this problem to ensure that all the facts are presented at this seminar and to make sure this meeting doesn’t turn into a riot. Additionally, a task force will present an informal assessment model to determine whether to establish a youth center in the community.</p><p>&lt;supervisor/&gt;</p><p>&lt;social science analyst/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Social Science Analyst, Aviva  </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Aviva Kim, a social science analyst. You are heading a task force to determine whether to establish a youth center in the community. You are holding an initial brainstorming session with the school chancellor to establish the specific assessment tools that are needed for this center, as well as who to contact for data. You will need to be open to discussing what went right, what went wrong, and how you would have done things differently with your assessment plan.</p><p>As you gather data with your chosen assessment tools, consider asking the following questions.</p><p>How serious is the gang violence problem? How many people are affected? You will need to describe the problem as carefully as possible. Is there a series of problems that must be prioritized? Is this a long-standing problem that has been ignored, or one for which previous solutions have failed? What factors cause or contribute to the problem? Do cultural experiences and values dramatically affect how people view the same set of events? Are there school policies regarding bullying?</p><p>Be prepared to describe a sketch of your assessment plan in your initial statement based on the parameters listed in your text. </p><p>&lt; metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Use assessment tools to determine community and neighborhood needs.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Use empathy, reflection, and interpersonal skills to effectively engage diverse clients and constituencies.</p><p>A-head: Assessment Tools to Determine Community and Neighborhood Needs</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
