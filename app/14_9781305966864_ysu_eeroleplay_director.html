Macro practice, in particular, often involves cause advocacy, which is work on behalf of groups of people, in particular, populations at risk, who lack the ability (resources, talent, or skill) to advocate for themselves.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, a unit supervisor at a social services agency develops advocacy tactics in order to elicit her directorâ€™s support in opposing a city construction project affecting the elderly population.   </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>Neighbors in the Elm Terrace section of our community are upset by a proposal to widen their street to allow larger trucks into the area. Many residents are elderly, low-income, and politically inexperienced. Greg Patten, the agency director of the local social services organization, is involved with the city council and appears to support the proposal. One of his unit supervisors works with the elderly population and asks for a meeting with Greg to explain their viewpoint.  </p><p>&lt;agency director/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Agency Director, Greg </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Greg Patten, the agency director. You have agreed to meet with one of your unit supervisors over how this new city project will affect the elderly in the area. You are under pressure to support the initiative by the city council, which heavily subsidizes your organization. But you know many in the elder community, as do your parents, so you are willing to look at solutions from one of your unit supervisors, who is known to be innovative.</p><p>Do you find his advocacy efforts to be effective? Why or why not? What other tactics might you offer?</p><p>&lt; metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Employ specific knowledge and skills in advocacy.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Engage in practices that advance social, economic, and environmental justice.</p><p>A-head: Advocacy Strategies and Tactics</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
