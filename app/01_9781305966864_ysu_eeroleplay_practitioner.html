A role is an expected behavior pattern for a person having a specified status or being involved in a designated social relationship. Social workers are expected to participate in certain activities. Some possible social work roles include enabler, mediator, manager, educator, analyst/evaluator, broker, facilitator, initiator, negotiator, mobilizer, and advocate. </p><p>Objective</p><p>In this role play, a social work practitioner and her supervisor discuss ways to bring together representatives from the various agencies that serve the center to establish more clearly defined communication channels. See Figures 1.4 through 1.14 in your text for an illustration of how various roles are enacted through the worker, supervisor, and the macro client systems.</p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>Wen, a social worker is employed by a neighborhood center and determines that the various workers and other professionals dealing with adolescent clients are not communicating with each other. For example, school social workers have no established procedure for conveying information to protective services workers who, in turn, do not communicate readily with probation and parole workers—despite the fact that these professionals are working with many of the same clients. Wen decides to talk to her supervisor, Laura, about the issue.</p><p>&lt;practitioner/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Practitioner, Wei </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Wei Tang, a social work practitioner at the social services agency. Describe the problems with communication across agencies to your supervisor, Laura.  Think about what macro roles are most relevant to individuals in each organization as you explain, and highlight any roles that may be missing or need to be augmented. Which of these — counselor, educator, broker, case manager, mobilizer, mediator, facilitator, integrator/coordinator, manager, initiator, negotiator, spokesperson, organizer, consultant, and advocate — would be most helpful with your current responsibilities?</p><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Demonstrate a wide range of professional roles.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Apply their understanding of social, economic, and environmental justice to advocate for human rights at the individual and system levels.</p><p>A-head:  Defining Generalist Practice: Assuming Many Professional Roles</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
