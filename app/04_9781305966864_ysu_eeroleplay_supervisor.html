And in the best case scenario, conflict can be positive and lead to new ideas and change.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, an administrator and a practitioner at a social services agency attempt to discuss differences in opinion about a policy at their agency in an effective manner.    </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>A conflict is brewing within the staff of the Loving Arms Hospital social work department regarding how to handle a hospital-proposed reduction in patient services.
