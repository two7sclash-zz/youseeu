One of the most concerning failures of workers is not keeping a supervisor current on potential crises. The supervisor, in turn, must listen actively to the practitioner’s concerns and provide mentoring and guidance where needed, while delegating responsibilities appropriately.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, the case manager of a women’s protective services agency evaluates a domestic violence situation in coordination with her supervisor to make a time-sensitive decision.</p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>A woman calls the police reporting that she has been battered by her husband. This is one of several calls over the past year. On this occasion, however, she is concerned about the health and safety of her five children and asks for help in leaving. Police officers are dispatched and the first responder on the case contacts the local women’s protective services to determine whether emergency shelter can be arranged. Tara Lopez, the case manager for the evening must quickly evaluate the case and report back to her supervisor, Jose, who tends to be more hands-off and also unavailable in the evenings. What steps in the crisis intervention model apply here?</p><p>&lt;case manager/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Case Manager, Natalie </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Natalie Sergev, the case manager at a women’s protective agency. You receive a call from the first responder of a domestic violence incident, and are charged with ensuring that each intervention or resource selected has been properly evaluated. You know your supervisor signs off on your decisions merely as a formality, but think these types of cases often require an immediate discussion due to their urgency and complexity. How can you proceed with the crisis intervention model? What approaches might you discuss with your supervisor for similar crises in the future, or as follow-up to this crisis?</p><p>&lt;metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Examine and implement crisis intervention.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Use supervision and consultation to guide professional judgment and behavior.</p><p>A-head: Crisis Intervention</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
