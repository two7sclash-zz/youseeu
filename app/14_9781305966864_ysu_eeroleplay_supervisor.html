Macro practice, in particular, often involves cause advocacy, which is work on behalf of groups of people, in particular, populations at risk, who lack the ability (resources, talent, or skill) to advocate for themselves.</p><h1>Objective</h1><p>In this role play, a unit supervisor at a social services agency develops advocacy tactics in order to elicit her directorâ€™s support in opposing a city construction project affecting the elderly population.   </p><h1>Scenario</h1><p>Neighbors in the Elm Terrace section of our community are upset by a proposal to widen their street to allow larger trucks into the area. Many residents are elderly, low-income, and politically inexperienced. Greg Patten, the agency director of the local social services organization, is involved with the city council and appears to support the proposal. One of his unit supervisors works with the elderly population and asks for a meeting with Greg to explain their viewpoint.  </p><p>&lt;supervisor/&gt;</p><p>&lt;unit supervisor/&gt;</p><h1>Notes for the Unit Supervisor, Rachel  </h1><p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Rachel Ramirez, a supervisor of a unit that works with the elderly population. You have requested a meeting with the agency director to advocate for this population to put in forth of the city council. Although the director appears to be in support of the construction project, you know he is concerned about his clients, and will potentially help brainstorm other tactics as well.   </p><p>Select an advocacy tactic you would use to oppose this proposal and explain why you chose this tactic.</p><p>&lt; metadata&gt;</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Employ specific knowledge and skills in advocacy.</p><p>Learning Objective Narrative: Engage in practices that advance social, economic, and environmental justice.</p><p>A-head: Advocacy Strategies and Tactics</p><p>&lt;/metadata&gt;</p><!-- build:js --><script class="jsdom" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><!-- endbuild --></section>
