<h2>An Ethical Dilemma</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Regardless of your employment setting, you will always be
working within the contexts of your organization and community.
Therefore, the surrounding environment will invariably affect
ethical decisions you make concerning what to do, what not to do,
what is right, and what is wrong within macro contexts. And
sometimes, you must make decisions when there is no absolutely
clear right thing to do.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a social work practitioner must weight her
supervisor’s admonition to uphold client confidentiality with her
concern about the safety of an individual known to the client.</p>
</section>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Samantha is a social worker in Dalanta County. She has an
excessively large case load. On Friday afternoon she has an
appointment with Marvin H. Marv has been coming to Samantha for
three weeks. He has been “down in the dumps” for a few months and
three weeks ago his girlfriend, Carmin told him to “get over it or
get out!”</p>
<p>Marv comes in and Samantha (his social worker) can tell he is
very agitated. He tells her he intends to hurt Carmin, who he says
“dumped him” for another guy.</p>
<p>According to the Dolgoff et al. (2005) Ethical Principles
Screen, a client has a right to autonomy and self-determination,
confidentiality and privacy. Yet Samantha is concerned about
possible harm to Marvin’s ex-girlfriend, Carmin.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Supervisor, Jeanette</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Jeanette Gropper,
the supervisor at the social services agency. You inform Samantha
about the agency’s policy of ensuring absolute confidentiality to
clients by discouraging workers from talking about cases with other
agencies without a written release of information from the client.
How does Samantha respond? Review the Dolgoff et al. (2005) Ethical
Principles Screen as you continue the conversation. How do these
principles inform your view?</p>
