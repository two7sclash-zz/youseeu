<h2>Program Evaluation</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It is our responsibility as social workers to keep current with
new literature in our field, inform our supervisors and others of
our findings; and work to ensure that our practices and programs
are the best they can be. As we learn what works and what does not
work, we change our programs and methods to reflect these
findings.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a unit manager at a social services agency
meets with the agency director to discuss the most effective design
for a program evaluation.</p>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>The Green Oak social services agency recently developed a
neighborhood watch program to combat the many burglaries and auto
thefts suffered by area residents. The police department has been
extremely cooperative in helping to establish this program, but the
Green Oaks agency director, Avi Gardner, isnâ€™t convinced that these
kinds of programs are worthwhile. He questions why the unit
involved spends their time on such activities. The unit manager,
Naveen Singh, meets to discuss designing an evaluation program to
show that this type of program is effective in reducing crime.</p>
<h2>Notes for the Unit Manager, Naveen</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Naveen Singh, the
unit manager for the neighborhood watch program. You are heavily
invested in this program, and have seen real results since its
inception. You know you can highlight its success though a
well-designed program evaluation. To prepare for your meeting with
the agency director to discuss the evaluation, answer the following
questions:</p>
<p>1. Which evaluation design do you want to use?</p>
<p>2. Why did you decide NOT to use the other designs?</p>
<p>3. What information will you provide in this evaluation?</p>
<p>4. How will you collect the data?</p>
<p>5. What types of graphics will you use and how will they be
presented?</p>
<p>End with a brief summary of what you see as the successes and
challenges of this initiative and ways in which you might improve
upon this in the future.</p>
