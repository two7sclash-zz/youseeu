<h2>Crisis Intervention</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A social work practitioner‘s interpersonal relationship with his
or her agency supervisor will always have special significance in
the macro environment. One of the most concerning failures of
workers is not keeping a supervisor current on potential crises.
The supervisor, in turn, must listen actively to the practitioner’s
concerns and provide mentoring and guidance where needed, while
delegating responsibilities appropriately.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, the case manager of a women’s protective
services agency evaluates a domestic violence situation in
coordination with her supervisor to make a time-sensitive
decision.</p>
</section>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>A woman calls the police reporting that she has been battered by
her husband. This is one of several calls over the past year. On
this occasion, however, she is concerned about the health and
safety of her five children and asks for help in leaving. Police
officers are dispatched and the first responder on the case
contacts the local women’s protective services to determine whether
emergency shelter can be arranged. Tara Lopez, the case manager for
the evening must quickly evaluate the case and report back to her
supervisor, Jose, who tends to be more hands-off and also
unavailable in the evenings. What steps can she follow in the
crisis intervention model?</p>

<h2>Note for the Supervisor, Jose</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Jose Rodriguez,
the supervisor at a women’s protective agency. You have protocols
in place for domestic violence incidents, which you think provide
sufficient guidelines for your case managers to make decisions.
However, the case manager at WPS feels that your direct assistance
will be needed to move the woman and her children to shelter, and
calls you for advice. How do you respond?</p>
