<h2>Creating Communication Channels</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Generalist practice in social work assumes the ability to
operate in a wide range of professional roles. A role is an
expected behavior pattern for a person having a specified status or
being involved in a designated social relationship. Social workers
are expected to participate in certain activities. Some possible
social work roles include enabler, mediator, manager, educator,
analyst/evaluator, broker, facilitator, initiator, negotiator,
mobilizer, and advocate.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a social work practitioner and her supervisor
discuss ways to bring together representatives from the various
agencies that serve the center to establish more clearly defined
communication channels. See Figures 1.4 through 1.14 in your text
for an illustration of how various roles are enacted through the
worker, supervisor, and the macro client systems.</p>
</section>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Wen, a social worker is employed by a neighborhood center and
determines that the various workers and other professionals dealing
with adolescent clients are not communicating with each other. For
example, school social workers have no established procedure for
conveying information to protective services workers who, in turn,
do not communicate readily with probation and parole
workers—despite the fact that these professionals are working with
many of the same clients. Wen decides to talk to her supervisor,
Laura, about the issue.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Practitioner, Wei</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Wei Tang, a social
work practitioner at the social services agency. Describe the
problems with communication across agencies to your supervisor,
Laura. Think about what macro roles are most relevant to
individuals in each organization as you explain, and highlight any
roles that may be missing or need to be augmented. Which of these —
counselor, educator, broker, case manager, mobilizer, mediator,
facilitator, integrator/coordinator, manager, initiator,
negotiator, spokesperson, organizer, consultant, and advocate —
would be most helpful with your current responsibilities?</p>
