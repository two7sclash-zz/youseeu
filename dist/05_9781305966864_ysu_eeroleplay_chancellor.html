<h2>Community Assessment</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">

<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>To be an effective community change agent, you must master
several techniques and approaches related to implementing
macro-level change. The problem-definition stage of assessment
should enable you to determine, with some degree of assurance, who
is affected by the problem, to what extent, and what sort of remedy
might be appropriate. No matter how the problem comes to your
attention, research must be done very carefully to ensure that you
have all the needed data.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a social services analyst designs a model to
research an urgent community issue surrounding school violence for
a town meeting. The analyst must find relevant and accurate data to
support a shift in local school policy, as the school chancellor is
hesitant to make any sweeping changes.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>The tiny community of Kingdom Come, an idyllic-looking rural
area in Michigan, is in an uproar after 16-year-old Estrallia
Compton was killed by a fellow student, Helena Troy. Estrallia was
a member of a gang of “mean girls” at school. They were a very
powerful group and one student said they were, “like, rockin’ with
the Facebook combat!” Apparently Helena had been an online “target”
of Estrallia, to the point that Helena felt the only way out was to
“plug the b - - - -.”</p>
<p>A town seminar has been called to focus on these gangs and gang
violence. The local social services agency has been called in to
research this problem to ensure that all the facts are presented at
this seminar and to make sure this meeting doesn’t turn into a
riot. Additionally, a task force will present an informal
assessment plan to determine whether to establish a youth center in
the community.</p>

<h2>Notes for the School Chancellor, Byron</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of the school
chancellor, Byron Jenkins. You want to address the issue of gang
violence, but would like to avoid being controlled by another
agency. To that end, you feel you need to make strong statements
that make it clear that the school is not to blame for the
incidents, but that they would like to be part of the solution.
Prepare for your role by having sample responses to the
following.</p>
<p>How serious is the gang violence problem? How many people are
affected? You will need to describe the problem as carefully as
possible. Is there a series of problems that must be prioritized?
Is this a long-standing problem that has been ignored, or one for
which previous solutions have failed? What factors cause or
contribute to the problem? Do cultural experiences and values
dramatically affect how people view the same set of events? Are
there school policies regarding bullying?</p>
<p>Consider your reaction to the assessment plan and intended tools
proposed by the task force based on the parameters listed in your
text.</p>
