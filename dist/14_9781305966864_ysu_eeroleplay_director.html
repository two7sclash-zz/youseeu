<h2>Advocacy Tactics</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Advocacy involves representing, championing, or defending the
rights of others. Macro practice, in particular, often involves
cause advocacy, which is work on behalf of groups of people, in
particular, populations at risk, who lack the ability (resources,
talent, or skill) to advocate for themselves.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a unit supervisor at a social services agency
develops advocacy tactics in order to elicit her directorâ€™s support
in opposing a city construction project affecting the elderly
population.</p>
</section>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Neighbors in the Elm Terrace section of our community are upset
by a proposal to widen their street to allow larger trucks into the
area. Many residents are elderly, low-income, and politically
inexperienced. Greg Patten, the agency director of the local social
services organization, is involved with the city council and
appears to support the proposal. One of his unit supervisors works
with the elderly population and asks for a meeting with Greg to
explain their viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Agency Director, Greg</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Greg Patten, the
agency director. You have agreed to meet with one of your unit
supervisors over how this new city project will affect the elderly
in the area. You are under pressure to support the initiative by
the city council, which heavily subsidizes your organization. But
you know many in the elder community, as do your parents, so you
are willing to look at solutions from one of your unit supervisors,
who is known to be innovative.</p>
<p>Do you find his advocacy efforts to be effective? Why or why
not? What other tactics might you offer?</p>
