<h2>The Planning Process</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When macro-change efforts are going to be undertaken, they will
most likely be generated by social workers employed in agencies
providing primarily micro and mezzo services. These workers must be
able to move the wheels of change from a job not necessarily
intended for that purpose.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, an administrator and practitioner at a social
services agency assess their respective styles of leadership and
collaborate to find the best approach to implementing change within
their organization.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Jenna Walker is a supervisor in a rural county social services
agency and Sara Gonzalez is a social worker who reports to her. The
towns within the county range in size from 1500 to 10,000 people,
and the area has become increasingly impoverished as a number of
small factories have closed. Sara comes up with an idea to start a
community food drive and proposes it enthusiastically at a staff
meeting. Jenna responds cautiously, and suggests that they arrange
a meeting to discuss the initiative. Eager to move forward, Sara
sends Jenna a follow-up e-mail with additional materials before the
meeting. Jenna reads through these in preparation and considers how
to respond.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Supervisor, Jenna</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Jenna Walker, the
supervisor at the social services agency. In terms of leadership
styles, Jenna display characteristics of what is known as a
“conserver”. She prefers to preserve the homeostatic status quo,
and is very thorough and procedural in her work. Some people at the
office have even referred to her as a “typical bureaucrat.” Jenna
loves filling out forms on a routine and timely basis. She tends to
be a strong proponent of goal displacement: quality of service is
not of much concern to her unless it involves your higher priority
of following the rules. She is generally skeptical of fresh and
innovative ideas that might disrupt the steady flow of paperwork.
In addition, she knows that her team is overworked.</p>
<p>As you listen to Sara, try to think about and appreciate the
positive qualities of her leadership style – the fact that she is
so enthusiastic, energetic, and innovative. Imagine and then
acknowledge how the project will help the community, the agency’s
clients, and the agency itself.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have an obligation to expect a certain
amount of detail in Sara’s proposal to effectively evaluate it. You
should carefully assess what problems are most critical to address
and you have only so much time, energy, and general resources.</p>
<p>Think about which problems might best translate into needs as
you meet with Sara on a macro, mezzo, and micro level. Be open to
discussing differences of opinion and ways in which how you can
collaborate together to come up with the best solution.</p>
