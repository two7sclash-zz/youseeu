<h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Conflict can occur in an infinite number of ways in an unending
array of contexts in micro, mezzo, and macro situations.
Disagreements over goals, methods, ideas, or almost any other topic
can lead to conflict. Conflict is also a natural outcome of our
efforts at advocating for others. And in the best case scenario,
conflict can be positive and lead to new ideas and change.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>A conflict is brewing within the staff of the Loving Arms
Hospital social work department regarding how to handle a
hospital-proposed reduction in patient services. The supervisor,
Charlene Diller, is concerned about the apparent split developing
over this proposal and arranges a meeting to hear the issues
numerous practitioners have raised. One social worker, Ron Barry,
has been particularly vocal via e-mail and not surprisingly, is the
first to speak up at the meeting.</p>
