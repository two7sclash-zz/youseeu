<h2>The Planning Process</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When macro-change efforts are going to be undertaken, they will
most likely be generated by social workers employed in agencies
providing primarily micro and mezzo services. These workers must be
able to move the wheels of change from a job not necessarily
intended for that purpose.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, an administrator and practitioner at a social
services agency assess their respective styles of leadership and
collaborate to find the best approach to implementing change within
their organization.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Jenna Walker is a supervisor in a rural county social services
agency and Sara Gonzalez is a social worker who reports to her. The
towns within the county range in size from 1500 to 10,000 people,
and the area has become increasingly impoverished as a number of
small factories have closed. Sara comes up with an idea to start a
community food drive and proposes it enthusiastically at a staff
meeting. Jenna responds cautiously, and suggests that they arrange
a meeting to discuss the initiative. Eager to move forward, Sara
sends Jenna a follow-up e-mail with additional materials before the
meeting. Jenna reads through these in preparation and considers how
to respond.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Practitioner, Sara</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Sara Gonzalez, a
social work practitioner at the social services agency. Sara’s
leadership style is that of a zealot. She is a go-getter who exudes
energy and thinks of creative, innovative ways to bring about
change. However, as a budding social worker, she is very
preoccupied with herself, and tends to think that she knows best,
regardless of others’ opinions. She may assume that Jenna will be
on board with her macro change proposal, and may not see Jenna’s
point of view, depending on how it fits into your view of the
universe.</p>
<p>As you listen to Jenna’s appraisal of your proposal, try to see
her responsibilities as an administrator and the need to weigh
several factors that might affect her organization on a macro
level. Propose why your initiative is necessary by outlining how
you evaluated the potential for macro-level intervention. Address
the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How heavily is the problem affecting clients’ well-being?</p>
<p>2. Is the problem serious enough to merit macro change?</p>
<p>3. Are you willing to think through and appraise your actual
potential to make a difference?</p>
<p>4. Are you certain that your clients would support such a macro
change and that it is in their best interest?</p>
<p>End with briefly defining and prioritizing any problems you
anticipate with your initiative. Note that innovations can involve
tried-and-true methods that are well known elsewhere but are
totally new in your own agency.</p>
