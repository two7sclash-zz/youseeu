<h2>Advocacy Tactics</h2>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Advocacy involves representing, championing, or defending the
rights of others. Macro practice, in particular, often involves
cause advocacy, which is work on behalf of groups of people, in
particular, populations at risk, who lack the ability (resources,
talent, or skill) to advocate for themselves.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a unit supervisor at a social services agency
develops advocacy tactics in order to elicit her directorâ€™s support
in opposing a city construction project affecting the elderly
population.</p>
</section>
<section class="sect2" data-role="collapsible">
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Neighbors in the Elm Terrace section of our community are upset
by a proposal to widen their street to allow larger trucks into the
area. Many residents are elderly, low-income, and politically
inexperienced. Greg Patten, the agency director of the local social
services organization, is involved with the city council and
appears to support the proposal. One of his unit supervisors works
with the elderly population and asks for a meeting with Greg to
explain their viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Unit Supervisor, Rachel</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Rachel Ramirez, a
supervisor of a unit that works with the elderly population. You
have requested a meeting with the agency director to advocate for
this population to put in forth of the city council. Although the
director appears to be in support of the construction project, you
know he is concerned about his clients, and will potentially help
brainstorm other tactics as well.</p>
<p>Select an advocacy tactic you would use to oppose this proposal
and explain why you chose this tactic.</p>
