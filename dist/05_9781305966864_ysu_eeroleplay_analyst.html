<h2>Community Assessment</h2>

<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>To be an effective community change agent, you must master
several techniques and approaches related to implementing
macro-level change. The problem-definition stage of assessment
should enable you to determine, with some degree of assurance, who
is affected by the problem, to what extent, and what sort of remedy
might be appropriate. No matter how the problem comes to your
attention, research must be done very carefully to ensure that you
have all the needed data.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this role play, a social science analyst designs a model to
research an urgent community issue surrounding school violence for
a town meeting. The analyst must find relevant and accurate data to
support a shift in local school policy, as the school chancellor is
hesitant to make any sweeping changes.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>The tiny community of Kingdom Come, an idyllic-looking rural
area in Michigan, is in an uproar after 16-year-old Estrallia
Compton was killed by a fellow student, Helena Troy. Estrallia was
a member of a gang of “mean girls” at school. They were a very
powerful group and one student said they were, “like, rockin’ with
the Facebook combat!” Apparently Helena had been an online “target”
of Estrallia, to the point that Helena felt the only way out was to
“plug the b - - - -.”</p>
<p>A town seminar has been called to focus on these gangs and gang
violence. The local social services agency has been called in to
research this problem to ensure that all the facts are presented at
this seminar and to make sure this meeting doesn’t turn into a
riot. Additionally, a task force will present an informal
assessment model to determine whether to establish a youth center
in the community.</p>

<h2>Notes for the Social Science Analyst, Aviva</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you are playing the role of Aviva Kim, a
social science analyst. You are heading a task force to determine
whether to establish a youth center in the community. You are
holding an initial brainstorming session with the school chancellor
to establish the specific assessment tools that are needed for this
center, as well as who to contact for data. You will need to be
open to discussing what went right, what went wrong, and how you
would have done things differently with your assessment plan.</p>
<p>As you gather data with your chosen assessment tools, consider
asking the following questions.</p>
<p>How serious is the gang violence problem? How many people are
affected? You will need to describe the problem as carefully as
possible. Is there a series of problems that must be prioritized?
Is this a long-standing problem that has been ignored, or one for
which previous solutions have failed? What factors cause or
contribute to the problem? Do cultural experiences and values
dramatically affect how people view the same set of events? Are
there school policies regarding bullying?</p>
<p>Be prepared to describe a sketch of your assessment plan in your
initial statement based on the parameters listed in your text.</p>
